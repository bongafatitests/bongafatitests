## About me

I am a Bcomm Information Systems Degree graduate with more years of experience in QA testing (Manual and Automation). Currently I'm working as a Quality Assurance Analyst for onedayonly.co.za. I am experienced in Selenium Web-driver & IDE for automation, Cucumber(Rubymine) for software supporting behavior driven
development, Jira - For bug reporting & tracking, Agile for Project Management & Software Development. I have a high availability mindset; I am thorough and very analytical when it comes to problem-solving and decision-making. I am very articulate in written or oral submissions and I strive to deliver with expedience and passion. I believe in a highly efficient workplace and via the optimal channeling of teamwork.

I wish to explore more in the field of Software testing via Automation using different programming languages to couple those languages with Rubymine, an automation programming language that I am very experienced in. I also wish to climb the corporate ladder in Software testing by becoming a Senior tester in the next year or so, and eventually become a Test Manager.
